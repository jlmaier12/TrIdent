slopeTranslator(
  viralSubset,
  bestMatchInfo,
  windowSize,
  slopeChange,
  leftOrRight
)
}
\arguments{
\item{viralSubset}{A subset of the read coverage pileup that pertains only to the contig currently being assessed}

\item{bestMatchInfo}{The pattern-match information associated with the current best pattern match.}

\item{windowSize}{The window size used to re-average read coverage pileups}

\item{leftOrRight}{The direction of the sloping pattern. Either "Left" for left to right (neg) slopes or "Right" for right to left (pos) slopes.}

\item{pattern}{A vector containing the values associated with the sloping pattern}
}
