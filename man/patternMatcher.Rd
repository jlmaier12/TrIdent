\usage{
patternMatcher(
  VLPpileup,
  WCpileup,
  windowSize,
  minBlockSize,
  maxBlockSize,
  minContigLength,
  minSlope
)
}
\arguments{
\item{VLPpileup}{A table containing contig names, coverages averaged over 100 bp windows, and contig positions associated with mapping VLP-fraction reads to whole-community contigs}

\item{WCpileup}{A table containing contig names, coverages averaged over 100 bp windows, and contig positions associated with mapping whole-community reads to whole-community contigs}

\item{windowSize}{The window size used to re-average read coverage datasets}

\item{minBlockSize}{The minimum size of the prophage-like block pattern. Default is 10,000 bp.}

\item{maxBlockSize}{The maximum size of the prophage-like block pattern. Default is NA}

\item{minContigLength}{The minimum contig size (in bp) to perform pattern-matching on. Must be at least 20,000 bp. Default is 30,000 bp.}

\item{minSlope}{The minimum slope value to test for sloping patterns}
}
\description{
Creates the viralSubset, representative of one contig, that is used as input for each individual
pattern-matching function. After the information associated with the best match for each pattern
is obtained, the pattern with the smallest match score is used to classify the contig being assessed.
Prior to the pattern-matching, contigs smaller than the minContigLength and contigs without 5,000 bp of 10x
read coverage are removed. Contigs less than 45,000 bp are matched against all three block pattern variations
and the NoPattern pattern. Contigs greater than 45,000 bp are matched against all pattern varieties.
