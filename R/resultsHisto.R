#' Create histogram of normalized pattern-match scores
#'
#' Plots a histogram of normalized match scores for all Prophage-like, Sloping and HighCovNoPattern classifications
#' and colors the plot based on the classifications. A suggested filtering threshold is provided for filtering results
#' based on the quality of the pattern-match.
#'
#' @param summaryList Classification summary table filtered to only include contigs with Prophage-like, Sloping and HighCovNoPattern classifications
#' @param suggFiltThresh TRUE or FALSE, Suggest a filtering threshold on the output pattern-match score histogram. Default is FALSE.
