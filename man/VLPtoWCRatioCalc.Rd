\usage{
VLPtoWCRatioCalc(classifSumm, WCpileup, VLPpileup)
}
\arguments{
\item{classifSumm}{Classification summary table}

\item{WCpileup}{A table containing contig names, coverages averaged over 100 bp windows, and contig positions associated with mapping whole-community reads to whole-community contigs}

\item{VLPpileup}{A table containing contig names, coverages averaged over 100 bp windows, and contig positions associated with mapping VLP-fraction reads to whole-community contigs}
}
\description{
Calculate the VLP-fraction:whole-community read coverage ratio for every contig using the median
read coverage values. If the ratio is greater than 2 (i.e VLP-fraction read coverage
is, on average, at least double the whole-community read coverage), then the contig is classified as HighCovNoPattern
