Description: 
  The `TrIdent` R package automates the analysis of transductomics data by detecting,
  classifying, and characterizing read coverage patterns associated with 
  potential transduction events. Transductomics is a DNA sequencing-based 
  method for the detection and characterization of transduction events in pure 
  cultures and complex communities. Transductomics relies on mapping sequencing
  reads from a viral-like particle (VLP)-fraction of a sample to contigs 
  assembled from the metagenome (whole-community) of the same sample. Reads 
  from bacterial DNA carried by VLPs will map back to the bacterial contigs of 
  origin creating read coverage patterns indicative of ongoing transduction.
