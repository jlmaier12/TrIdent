\details{
This dataset represents one half of a complete transductomics dataset which is comprised of two parts-
a whole-community fraction and a viral-like particle (VLP)-fraction. This dataset represents the
VLP fraction and was generated by purifying VLPs from a conventional mouse fecal homogenate using CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation.
The VLP-fraction extracted DNA was sequenced with Illumina (paired-end mode, 150 bp reads)
The sequencing reads were mapped to the associated whole-community assembly using BBMap from the BBTools suite.
The bbmap.sh bincov parameter with covbinsize=100 was used to create a pileup file with 100 bp windows. A
subset of 10 contigs from the pileup file were selected for this sample dataset. The contigs were chosen because their associated
read coverage patterns in the VLP-fraction exemplify TrIdent's pattern-matching functionality across classifications:
NODE_617: Prophage-like, active/abundant, with spec transduction
NODE_125: Prophage-like, off one side of contig, no spec transduction
NODE_352: Sloping, left to right slope
NODE_251: Sloping, right to left slope
NODE_2060: Sloping, right to left slope with start
NODE_1401: None, no pattern match
NODE_62: Prophage-like, with spec transduction
NODE_368: Prophage-like, not homogeneously integrated/present, no spec transduction
NODE_560: HighCovNoPattern
NODE_1165: None, filtered out
