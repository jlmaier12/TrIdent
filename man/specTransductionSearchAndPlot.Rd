\arguments{
\item{contigName}{The reference name of the contig currently being assessed (i.e "NODE_1")}

\item{VLPpileup}{A table containing contig names, coverages averaged over 100 bp windows, and contig positions associated with mapping VLP-fraction reads to whole-community contigs}

\item{classifPatternMatches}{The pattern match information associated with each contig classified as prophage-like,  sloping, or HighCovNoPattern}

\item{classifSumm}{The summary information associated with each contig classified as Prophage-like, Sloping, or HighCovNoPattern}

\item{windowSize}{The window size used to re-average read coverage pileups}

\item{i}{The index for the contig currently being assessed}

\item{noReadCov}{How many bp of no read coverage are encountered before searching stops? Default is 500.}

\item{specTransLength}{How many bp of read coverage to look for outside of prophage borders? Default is 2000.}

\item{logScale}{If TRUE, coverage is plotted in log10. If FALSE, raw coverage values are plotted. Default is FALSE.}
